# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please privately report it via the Security tab on the correct GitHub repository (see [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)). If that is impossible, feel free to send an email to **hi@imam.dev** instead.

You can expect a response within 48 hours if you are a human reporting a genuine issue.

If the reported system vulnerability is accepted, then there must be a reward, at least close to the level of benefit provided or potential problems from the vulnerability, and by considering the remaining available reward capability.

All security vulnerabilities will be promptly verified and addressed. 

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions and other dependencies by maintaining lock files (e.g. `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lockb`, or `requirements.txt`) in order to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
